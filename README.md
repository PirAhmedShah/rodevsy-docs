# 🚀 [Project Name] - SDLC Documentation

This folder contains the core software development lifecycle (SDLC) documents for this project. The goal is to provide a single source of truth for all business, requirements, design, and testing artifacts.

## Structure

- **/business/**: The "Why." Contains the problem statement, product vision, stakeholder information, and user personas.
- **/requirements/**: The "What." Contains functional (what it does) and non-functional (how it performs) requirements, use cases, and a glossary.
- **/design/**: The "How." Contains system architecture diagrams, API specifications, UI/UX mockups, and key architectural decisions (ADRs).
- **/testing/**: The "Proof." Contains the master test plan, test strategies, and links to test cases and defect reports.
- **/backlog/**: The "Work." Contains the high-level product backlog, epics, and templates for user stories.

*(Top-level documents like `risk-register.md` and `user-journey.md` cover cross-cutting concerns.)*
